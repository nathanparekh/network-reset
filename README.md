# Network Reset
- To reconnect to the internet whenever it cuts out
    - because the internet at our school sucks and needs that
- I _think_ it's compatible from at least Python 2.6 and up but maybe not... I'm not sure.
- Don't expect any high-quality code
    - still, _please_ try to improve on it... MR's welcome.

Where it works right now:
- Windows
